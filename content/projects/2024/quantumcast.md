For more than a century, the Science Association has been dedicated to 
improving the scientific knowledge and curiosity of the students of Royal 
College. Continuing this tradition, we launched a new science-themed podcast named **QuantumCast'24**, with the participation of various personalities in the scientific and technological fields.

We invited leading professors in various fields of science to feature in these episodes, in addition to former students of Royal College who have achieved remarkable feats in the academical field. The final episode was completed with the participation of the top board of RCSA, discussing about our club and the services rendered by it.

The Launching Ceremony was held on the same day as the final round of Forza Scientia â€˜24, an inner and inter school quiz organized by our club. After the launching, all **7 episodes** were uploaded to **YouTube**, gaining many views in a short period of time.
