**Spreading Waves of Scientific Thought**

Sci Clone’24 is a signature initiative of the Royal College Science Association, designed to ignite scientific curiosity and foster a culture of inquiry among young minds. This year’s edition featured a multifaceted approach to science communication and engagement:



* **Sci Clone Magazine**: A high-quality physical publication showcasing student research articles, expert interviews, and thought-provoking content across scientific disciplines. It serves as a platform for Royalists to explore beyond textbooks and express their scientific insights creatively.

* **Sci Facts’24**: A digital poster campaign that delivered engaging, bite-sized scientific facts to a broad audience through social media. Each poster was visually captivating and conceptually rich, aimed at making science both accessible and enjoyable.


Together, these components created a dynamic outreach movement, spreading a "clone" of scientific inspiration among students and the wider public. *Sci-Clone’24* not only highlighted the scientific talents of Royal College students but also encouraged knowledge-sharing, creativity, and enthusiasm for discovery.

**Editors of the Magazine**
